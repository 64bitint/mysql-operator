# This sample creates a very simple InnoDB Cluster similar to the one in
# sample-cluster.yaml but also provides additional configuration variables for the
# MySQL Server. This will be deployed onto the MySQL Server Pods on creation. Mind
# that formatting inside the YAML file and that the operator will not validate 
# these before deploying.
