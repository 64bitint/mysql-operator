# This sample creates a very simple InnoDB Cluster with help from the MySQL Operator.
# This will have 3 MySQL Server Pods, one of them will be primary and there will be
# one MySQL Router in a Pod. It will use self-signed TLS certificates.
# It requires the Operator to be deployed and credentials for your "root" user 
# provided via a secret called mypwds (see sample-secret.yaml)
